      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <div class="updated">Last Updated: [Insert Date]</div>

      <p>
        [App Name] ("we", "our", or "us") values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal and financial information. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, stored, and protected when you use our application.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect and Use</h2>
      <p>
        We collect and use information only as necessary to provide and improve the app’s core functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>1.1 User-Provided Financial Data</h2>
      <p>The app allows you to create and manage personal financial records, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Transaction information such as income, expenses, and notes</li>
        <li>Budgets, limits, and financial goals</li>
        <li>Categories and labels you assign</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data is used solely to provide app features such as tracking, summaries, and insights. We do not sell, share, or use your financial data for advertising purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>1.2 Account Information (Optional)</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to create an account to enable data synchronization, we may collect an email address for identification, authentication, and account recovery. If third-party sign-in is used, only basic profile information required for authentication is processed.
      </p>

      <h2>1.3 Device and Usage Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may process limited technical information such as device type, operating system version, and app performance data to ensure stability and improve user experience.
      </p>

      <h2>1.4 Advertising (Free Version Only)</h2>
      <p>
        The free version of the app may display advertisements to support ongoing development. Advertising data is handled separately and is not linked to your personal financial records.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How Your Data Is Stored</h2>

      <h2>2.1 Local-Only Storage (Guest Mode)</h2>
      <p>
        When using the app without an account, your financial data is stored only on your device. We do not collect or access this data. If the app is removed or the device is lost, the data cannot be recovered by us.
      </p>

      <h2>2.2 Cloud Storage (Optional Sync)</h2>
      <p>
        If cloud synchronization is enabled, your data is stored in encrypted form on secure remote servers. This allows backup and access across multiple devices.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell or share your personal or financial data with third parties except where required to operate essential app features or comply with legal obligations.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may edit or delete your data at any time within the app</li>
        <li>You may request permanent deletion of your account and associated data</li>
        <li>Limited technical data may be retained temporarily for security or compliance purposes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
      <p>
        We apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, or loss. All data transmissions are encrypted and access is restricted to authorized parties only.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        This app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
      </p>
